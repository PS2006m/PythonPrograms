Main object oriented concepts are Class , object , Inheritance ,  Polymorphism , Abstraction and Encapsulation
Class :- Class is a group of different type of variables and functions
Object :- Object is an instance of class
Inheritance :- Object of one class can acquire the properties of object of another class . or . creating a new class from an existing class
               is called inheritance.
Polymorphism :- One name multiple form
                1.Method Overloading
                2.Method Overriding
                    1.Method Overloading : Also called compile-time Polymorphism . When there is more than one method in a single class
                                           having the same name but with a different number of arguments then it is called method overloading
                    2.Method Overriding : Also called run-time polymorphism . When there is a same method prototype in your both base
                                          class and derived class and if you call that method using the object of derived class than only
                                          derived class method will be called , so you can say that method of derived class overrides the
                                          method of base clas
Abstraction : It is used for mainly data hiding
Encapsulation : To bind a code and data into a single unit is called Encapsulation
